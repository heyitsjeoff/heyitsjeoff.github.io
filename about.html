        My path to computer science started on a whim to take an introduction to programming course. From that moment onward, my life was changed for the better.<br>
        I am a recent graduate from Pacific Lutheran University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. From my studies, I have worked primarily in Java, but have also programmed in other languages such as C, Python, and Swift; along with database management using MySQL.<br>
        Along with my courses, I have participated in 3 group projects that have provided me with experience in a team environment:<br>
          - Gomoku: The classic board game built using Java with the ability to play with others over a network. This introduced me to the MVC design pattern.<br>
          - OnTrack: A web application to help CS students plan their academic schedule. This was built using Java, MySQL, HTML, and Javascript.<br>
          - Where U At: A messaging application for iOS that also allowed users to broadcast their location to a friend, which is viewable on a map. This was built using Swift for the client side and Node.js for the server with MySQL for the database. <br>
        After my last year at PLU, I learned that I really enjoyed both projects and am currently learning the MEAN stack because of how interesting and powerful it can be. OnTrack showed me how fun web development can be and Where U At exposed me to Node.js, Express, and Swift. <br>
