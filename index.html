						<h3>When was the language developed?</h3>
							<p>
								Lua was originally developed in July, 1993.  This version, Lua 1.0, was not released to the public.  Lua 1.1 was the first version of Lua to be released to the public on July 8, 1994, and featured simple syntax and a bytecode virtual machine.  Lua 2.1 was released in 1995 and provided support for object-oriented programming.  1998 saw the release of Lua 3.1, which added elements of functional programming.  Lua 4.0 came out in 2000 and added for statements and a new API.  After 2006, when Lua 5.0 came out, updates in the language have not been as numerous.  There have been three updates of Lua 5.0 since 2006, with features including better error handling, integers, and booleans

						<h3>Development responsibility</h3>
							<p>
								Lua was developed by Roberto Lerusalimschy, Waldemar Celes, and Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, or PUC-Rio, in Brazil.  The name &quot;Lua&quot; is not an acronym, but actually means &quot;moon&quot; in Portuguese.  Lua is now housed at a laboratory of the computer science department of PUC-Rio.

						<h3>Influences</h3>
							<p>
								Among the languages that influenced the development of Lua were: C++, CLU, Modula, Scheme, and SNOBOL.  Lua has also influenced numerous languages, including: Io, GameMonkey, Squirrel, Falcon, MiniD, and Julia.

						<h3>For what paradigm or domain was it developed and/or used?</h3>
							<p>
								Lua is a multi-paradigm programming language, originally designed as a scripting language. Some paradigms represented are functional, object-oriented, and imperative. Lua achieves object-oriented programming without built in concepts of classes or objects. Object are created by putting functions and related data in a table. Classes are simulated by cloning object prototypes.
